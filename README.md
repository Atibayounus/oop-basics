##Core OOP Concepts
##Class

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It contains data members and member functions.

###Object

An object is an instance of a class.
It represents real-world entities and is used to access class members.

##Constructor

A constructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object is created.
It is used to initialize data members of a class.

##Destructor
A destructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
It is used to release resources and perform cleanup operations.

##Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of binding data and functions together into a single unit (class).
It helps in data hiding and security.

##Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behavior of another class.
It helps in code reusability.

##Polymorphism

Polymorphism means “many forms”.
It allows the same function or object to behave differently in different situations.

##Abstraction

Abstraction hides the internal implementation details and shows only the essential features to the user.

##Access Specifiers

. Private
. Public
. Protected

These control the accessibility of class members.

##Tools and Language

Programming Language: C++

IDE/Compiler: Dev-C++

##Summary

Object-Oriented Programming in C++ helps structure programs using classes and objects, making code more modular, secure, and easy to maintain.
